<h3>The simplest app state management for React.</h3>

- __Minimalist API__; no complicated concepts or boilerplate
- Use __plain functions__ to update state (including async)
- Largely __unopinionated__ with flexible syntax
- Extremely __simple to unit test__ state logic
- Highly extensible with __plug-ins__ (e.g. persistence, dev tools)
- Full __TypeScript__ support with uncomplicated types
- Made specifically for React, and built on __React Hooks__ 
- Multiple times __faster__ than context/reducer solution
- It's tiny, just __around 1 KB__ (minified + gzipped)
