# Binding Only Relevant Data (Partial or Computed Values)

There are cases where a component doesn't need the exact value of the entity, but rather some derivative of this value. It can either be:
- a portion of the value (e.g. for object type values), or 
- a computed value

By binding only these relevant values to the component, we prevent unnecessary re-renders. For this purpose, we can pass a _transform_ function to the entity's `use` hook as follows:
```js
value = entityObj.use(value => relevantValue)
```
This transform function, also called _selector_ in other conventions, takes the current entity value, then returns some other value that is more relevant to the component. The hook then binds only this derived value to the component, thus preventing unnecessary re-renders.

Here's an example:

**MainView.js**
```jsx
import { settings } from './entities/settings'

const RiggedCounter = () => {
  //                     partial value   ðŸ‘‡
  const extra = settings.use(value => value.extra)
  //                    computed value   ðŸ‘‡
  const count = counter.use(value => value + extra)
  
  return ( 
    //  . . .
  )
}
```
(Due to type inference, the TypeScript version is the same as above.)

> Below are some more advanced topics that pertain to __optional__ features that are provided for flexibility.

## Using a custom equality function

When deciding whether it should trigger a re-render, `use` compares the current vs. previous result of the transform function. The default equality check used is `===` (strict equality), but we can specify a different equality function if needed.
```js
value = entityObj.use(transformFn, equalityFn)
```
The `equalityFn` is expected to come in this form:
```js
(a, b) => boolean
```

### Shallow equality

The library provides `shallowEqual` for cases where the transform function returns an object with top-level properties derived from the entity value. In the example below, `shallowEqual` returns `true`â€”and therefore the component will __not__ updateâ€”if both `theme` and `enableCountdown` properties of the computed value did not change.

**MainView.js**
```jsx
import { shallowEqual } from 'simpler-state'
import { settings } from './entities/settings'

const MainView = () => {
  const config = settings.use(value => {
    return {
      theme: value.theme,
      enableCountdown: value.featureFlags.countdown
    }
  }, shallowEqual)
  //      ðŸ‘†
  return ( 
    //  . . .
  )
}
```
(Due to type inference, the TypeScript version is the same as above.)

## Optimization

To further enhance the app's performance, it's always a good idea to _memoize_ the transform and equality functions. We can choose from various techniques, such as:
- defining them outside the component
- placing them alongside the entity and its actions
- using React's `useCallback` hook to keep them inside the component
